You can redefine or overload most of the built-in operators available in C#. Thus a programmer can use operators with user-defined types as well.
Overloaded operators are functions with special names the keyword operator followed by the symbol for the operator being defined. 
similar to any other function, an overloaded operator has a return type and a parameter list.
The above function implements the addition operator (+) for a user-defined class Box.
It adds the attributes of two Box objects and returns the resultant Box object.
